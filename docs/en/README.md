# RecoverySwap Documentation

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation for **RecoverySwap**, a sophisticated DeFi aggregator designed specifically for depegged token recovery and optimal swap routing.

## What is RecoverySwap?

RecoverySwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) aggregator that helps users recover value from depegged tokens by finding the most efficient swap routes across multiple liquidity sources. The platform combines advanced routing algorithms with performance optimization to provide the best possible rates for token swaps.

- Intelligent pre-approval detection for seamless user experience
- Optimized gas usage through efficient contract interactions

### üîó **Multi-Router Aggregation**
- Integration with multiple DEX routers (Uniswap V2, SushiSwap, and more)
- Real-time liquidity analysis across different protocols
- Automatic route optimization for best swap rates

### üìä **Advanced Analytics**
- Real-time transaction monitoring via external API integration
- Comprehensive transaction history without RPC limitations
- Performance metrics and success rate tracking

### üõ°Ô∏è **Security & Reliability**
- Extensive smart contract testing and auditing
- Robust error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Input validation and security best practices
